🌿 Yo, folks! The name's pip-pip-pip (sensor), but you can just call me "nji". I'm a chill Software Engineer with a frontend focus for my 9-to-5 gig, but I also dabble in some full-stack wizardry for my freelance/side hustle. I'm all about that laid-back vibe while keeping things pro in the coding game. My heart beats for cutting-edge mobile and web tech, all while keeping the developer experience (DX) on point. Let's vibe and code! ✌️
